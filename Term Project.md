### IE 364 -- IE 3064
#### TERM PROJECT GUIDELINE

The Project will be done by teams of 1-3 students. (4 friends will make two teams) Each team will write a one-page project proposal by March 7. The proposal should include its feasibility, data needs, key performance measures and types of experimentation. Students will develop their simulation model, perform experimentation, write up a report, and present the project to the instructors.


#### Project Grading Scheme

* Problem and System Description:
  -  Project Goals and Performance measures
  -  System sketch or flow diagram
  -  Describe relationship between key variables if any
  -  What assumptions are you making about the system
  -  Data source: How the data was collected
  -  Show the fitted distributions including their p value
  -  Describe experiment that you run with the Model
  -  Organize and Summarize output in at most 3 pages
* ARENA Model
  -  Correct usage of the model: layout
  -  use animation
  -  include a printout of base case model
  -  Originality and creativity
* Experimentation, Output Analysis, Conclusions
  -  Describe experiments that you ran with the model.
  -  Organize / Summarize output using graphs and tables
  -  Overall quality
  -  Key factor: Content, grammar and format
* Presentation
  -  Organization (all members of the group must be attend)
  -  Clarity
  -  Timing (8 minutes)
